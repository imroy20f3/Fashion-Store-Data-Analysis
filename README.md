# Fashion-Store-Data-Analysis-using-MS-Excel
In this project, I analyzed a fashion retail dataset to uncover key business insights using Microsoft Excel. I cleaned and structured the raw data, then built an interactive report using PivotTables and charts. The report highlights essential performance metrics such as total sales, profit by region, top-performing products, and customer segments.
The dashboard allows easy filtering by category, region, and time period to support data-driven decision-making. This project demonstrates my ability to use Excel for analytical reporting, summarize large datasets, and create clear visual insights that help understand business trends.
